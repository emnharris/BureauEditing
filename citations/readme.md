# Bureau Citation Style for Microsoft Word

## About
Microsoft Word has a tool for adding sources and turning them into citations and bibliographies styled according to several popular stylebooks, including Chicago, APA, and MLA. Unfortunately, these styles do not correspond to the Bureau of Economic Geology's preferred reference style, and there is no Microsoft-supported function for adding a custom style. Currently, the only way to create a custom style for user-specific utilization in Word is to write a custom `.XSL`, or *Extensible Stylesheet Language*, file and save it to the user's application data for Word.

The `.XSL` file in this repository was created with the help of [BibWord](https://github.com/codingo/BibWord) (originally created by [Yves Dhondt](mailto:yves.dhondt@gmail.com), maintained on GitHub by [@codingo](https://github.com/codingo)).

The installation process, current product status, and further resources are listed below.

## Installation
Download the `.XSL` file. Determine where Microsoft Word's program files are stored on your computer, and navigate to the \Bibliography directory, then the \Style directory.

**Example file path:** *This PC > Windows (C:) > User > AppData > Roaming > Microsoft > Bibliography > Style*

❗ Note that if you don't have *View > Hidden Items* enabled, you will not be able to see hidden folders such as \AppData.

You will notice several other `.XSL` documents in this location for other styles that come preloaded with Word, such as Chicago, APA, and MLA. Save the file BEG.xsl alongside these other styles. Note that you may need administrative permission on your machine to do this.

If you have Word open already, close it and restart the program to load the Bureau style option. The style should appear as the option "Bureau of Economic Geology (First Edition)" unless you change the stylename element in the `.XSL` to something else.

## Current Status
Currently, this `.XSL` file is not programmed to deliver the capability of either sorting references by alphabetical order, replacing repeat author names with bars, or applying character suffixes to multiple instances of same author, same year. I'm currently working on creating the proper extension element to fix the alphabetization. In the meantime, if you wish to use this style, consider using the following workflow:

### Alternate Workflow
Import sources and use citations as normal. Once a document is finalized and should not go through further editing or source adding, select the autogenerated bibliography so the options menu appears. Select the small drop-down button on the left, then select *Convert Bibliography to Static Text*.

Note that this will allow you to then sort in alphabetical order, add year suffixes (e.g., 2015a), and add bars for repeat authors, but it will also break the connection between the bibliography and the inline citations. If you change the author name or year, you will have to manually search for the citations and change them manually.

## Other Helpful Information
Remember to add parentheses around inline citations and put semicolons (;) between different entries in the same location (e.g., Scanlon, 2017; Reedy 2018; Wolver 2019). Remember to put them in chronological order, then alphabetical order. (It's on my list to eventually automate this too.)

If you would like to site a *Thesis*, use the *Report* style in the Word drop-down menu when adding a source.
