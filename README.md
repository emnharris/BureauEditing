## Tools
### Macros
The macro collection consists of several macros for use with Microsoft Word that have been programmed to complete basic, automatable editing tasks:
* __SpaceErase with EgieCommas.__ Removes multiple spaces, spaces before carriage returns, and spaces around dashes and hyphens. Adds commas after i.e. and e.g.
* __AcronymFlag.__ Flags acronyms consisting of at least two capital letters.
* __Unit Flag.__ Flags units of measure and math symbols.
* __Blacklist Flag.__ Flags commonly misused phrases.

See the collection read-me for more information.

### Bureau Citation Style
With the help of [BibWord](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=bibword), users can custom styles to use with Word's Citation and Bibliography tools.

This tool is currently unable to handle alphabetical sorting of references and should only be used with a modified workflow to accommodate this shortcoming. See the program read-me for more information.

## Tips
If you would like to edit any of these tools, it helps to have a good plain-text editor. Notepad will allow you to write in plain text, but it's not always easy saving documents with extensions other than `.TXT`. I recommend getting a good text editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which has the added benefit of color formatting to go with whatever file extension you're using.

## Future Goals
* AutoCorrect and Find-Replace `.VBA` tools (Macros)
* year suffixes and author bars for bibliographies (Bureau Citation Style)
